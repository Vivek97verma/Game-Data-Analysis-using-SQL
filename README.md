# Player-Behavior-and-Game-Performance-Analysis-Using-SQL
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of player behavior and game performance metrics to identify patterns that impact user engagement and retention. The objective was to leverage data-driven insights to enhance gameplay experience and improve key performance indicators.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

> Extracted and transformed large datasets from gaming databases using advanced SQL techniques, including complex joins, subqueries, and window functions.
> Analyzed player engagement metrics such as session duration, frequency, retention rates, and churn, providing actionable insights for game developers and marketing teams.
> Identified critical success factors and key behavioral segments that drive user retention, leading to targeted strategies for player engagement and monetization.

Tools and Technologies Used:

SQL: For data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, organization, and preliminary analysis.
